# Particle flow sprites

This directory contains sprites for particle flow as follows:

![](/images/particle-flow/description.png)

Each sprite file is 100 x 100 px, and grid lines are not supposed to appear in the sprite file itself. The grid lines appear in the picture above to show you differences only. Each sprite also has different volume of particles, e.g. 01 means particles fill up 10% of the middle row. The particles are supposed to stay at the middle row since the middle row has the same width as vacuum tubes. 10_1, 10_2, and 10_3 can be switched on the fly to make particles look more dynamic when it travels along the accelerator.
